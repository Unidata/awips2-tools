Usage documentation for convertBundles.


The program convertBundles converts legacy system bundle and color table
netcdf files into A-II xml format bundles and color table files.  If run
with no arguments, will print out this usage message.


There are two main primary usages for convertBundles:

   convertBundles {a} {q} {l} {m} {v} netcdfPath
   convertBundles {a} {q} {l} {m} {v} netcdfPath xmlPath ...

In these idealized usage examples, netcdfPath is the full path to
any old style D-2D netcdf bundle file.  The first usage writes the
text of a Cave xml bundle to stdout.  For the second usage, xmlPath
is the full path to any file to write the text of a Cave xml bundle to;
there can be any number of netcdfPath / xmlPath pairs.  There are five
optional literal single character flags that can change the behavior of
the program:

 a - Invokes a behavior where if a useable 'overlay' entry does not
     already exist for a given depict key in BundleConversionInfo.txt,
     the file overlay-kkkk.xml (where kkkk is the depict key for the
     overlay) will automatically be used for this purpose if it exists.
 q - Any diagnostic output to stdout is suppressed.
 l - Diagnostic output includes a list of supporting xml files used in
     specifically to support the conversion of each overlay.
 m - List all supporting xml files read by the program regardless of
     purpose. 
 v - Verbose diagnostic output, everything from l and m plus alot more.


There are four other primary usages triggered by a different set of
optional literal single character flags, described below.


This usage, triggered by the 'c' literal flag, performs legacy to A-II
color table conversion.  The legacyColorMap.nc is the path to a legacy
color table netcdf file, which may contain many color table files.
outColorMapDir is the path to a directory where the output A-II xml
color table files are to be written.  This directory must already exist. 

     convertBundles c legacyColorMap.nc outColorMapDir


This usage, triggered by the 'o' literal flag, takes an input xml file
and strips out everything before the first occurence of <resource> and
after the last occurence of </resource>.  This is meant to help with
preparing overlay specific xml files for customization.

     convertBundles o bundleDump.xml overlaySpecific.xml


This usage, triggered by the 'p' literal flag, removes nearly all extraneous
whitespace from bundle xml, and formats it in a very consistent way. This is
meant to make direct comparisons of two different bundle xml files easier.

     convertBundles p anyBundle.xml minimalWhiteSpace.xml


This usage, triggered by the 'r' literal flag, reports the contents of any
arbitrary list of legacy netcdf bundles.

     convertBundles r netcdfPath ...
